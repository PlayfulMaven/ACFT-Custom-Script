# ACFT-Custom-Script
 This repo contains a set of custom R functions that convert raw scores (including times) from each ACFT event and score them accordingly. Note that these functions do not work for the 2023 ACFT sex- and age-based scoring guidelines.
 **These functions were originally created in May 2021, but stored on a private repo.** I'm uploading them here to demonstrate my ability to create custom functions to improve data entry efficiency.
